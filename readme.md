## About Bookworm

Bookworm is an app created by Pauline McGinnis, Jennifer Farrington, Tracey Bradley, and Jonny Calderon. It is for avid readers to keep track of books they want to read, have read, and to see what other people are reading. Users have the ability to add books and add them to their "To Be Read" list or their "Finished" list, and see each list. Users are also able to take a look at all books that all users have added, and copy other users' books into their own library. 

This app was created in React and demonstrates full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.
